This project @ BeCode.org as part of the AI Bootcamp in Gent.

# Description:
The project is about:
* To apply a regression in a real context.
* To preprocess data for machine learning.
* To analize the results of a machine learning model. 

# Installation:
* create new environment in the path where you needed.
* create '.gitignore' and move the new environment if created.
* install the following modules in your environment:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. sklearn.model_selection
4. sklearn.linear_model
5. sklearn.preprocessing
6. xgboost
7. sklearn.tree
8. sklearn.neighbors
9. sklearn.ensemble
10. sklearn.metrics

use following links to get to know more about modules and its installation:-

# Usage:
* This project contains notebooks in `data-exploration` folder and .py files in `src` folder.
* use 'main.py' to run the program.

# Output:
* LinearRegression
* DecisionTreeReg
* NeighborsReg
* xgboostReg
* RandomForestReg

The above output for 10,000 scrapped and analysed data from immoweb website.
This helps to predict 'price' for new data

# Completion:
* Name - Mythili Palanisamy
* Repository - analysing and regression
* Type of Challenge - Consolidation
* Duration - 4.5 days
* Submission - 20/07/2023 4:30 PM
* Team challenge - solo
