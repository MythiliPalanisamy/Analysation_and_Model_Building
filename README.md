# Project Prediction
This project @ BeCode.org as part of the AI Bootcamp in Gent.

# Description:
This project contains two parts:
* analysation ( data exploration)
* regression (model building)

# Installation:
Install the following modules in your environment:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. sklearn.model_selection
4. sklearn.linear_model
5. sklearn.preprocessing
6. xgboost
7. sklearn.tree
8. sklearn.neighbors
9. sklearn.ensemble
10. sklearn.metrics
11. seaborn
12. matplotlib.pyplot 


# Usage:
OUTPUT - analysation
* correlation
* Expensive municipalities (more and less)
* Relationship between price and other variables

OUTPUT - Regression
* LinearRegression
* DecisionTreeReg
* NeighborsReg
* xgboostReg
* RandomForestReg

We get the above output for 10,000 scrapped and analysed data of immoweb.
This helps to predict 'price' for new data
