# Project Prediction
This project @ BeCode.org as part of the AI Bootcamp in Gent.

# Description:
This project contains two parts:
* analysation ( data exploration)
* regression (model building)

# Installation:
* install numpy, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot with 'pip install numpy'.
* install pandas, numpy, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.preprocessing, xgboost, sklearn.tree, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.metrics

# Usage:
OUTPUT - analysation
* correlation
* Expensive municipalities (more and less)
* Relationship between price and other variables

OUTPUT - Regression
* LinearRegression
* DecisionTreeReg
* NeighborsReg
* xgboostReg
* RandomForestReg

We get the above output for 10,000 scrapped and analysed data of immoweb.
This helps to predict 'price' for new data
