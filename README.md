# Analysation and Regression model
This project @ BeCode.org as part of the AI Bootcamp in Gent.

## Description:
This project contains two parts:
* analysation ( data exploration)
* regression (model building)

## Installation:
[![pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-1.3.5-red)](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/1.3/getting_started/install.html)

* clone the repository
* install the specified modules within the required environment 

## Result
### Analysation:  
* correlation
* Expensive municipalities (more and less)
* Relationship between price and other variables

### Regression:  
* LinearRegression
* DecisionTreeReg
* NeighborsReg
* xgboostReg
* RandomForestReg

--> The output is for 10,000 scrapped and analysed data from immoweb.
--> This helps to predict 'price' for new data.
