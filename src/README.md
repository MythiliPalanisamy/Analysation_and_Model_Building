## Regression
This project @ BeCode.org as part of the AI Bootcamp in Gent.

# Description:
The project is about:
* To apply a regression in a real context.
* To preprocess data for machine learning.
* To analize the results of a machine learning model. 

# Installation:
* create new environment in the path where you needed.
* create '.gitignore' and move the new environment if created.
* install pandas, numpy, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.preprocessing, xgboost, sklearn.tree, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.metrics

# Usage:
* This project contains notebooks and .py files in '/src'.
* use 'main.py' to run the program.

# Output:
* LinearRegression
* DecisionTreeReg
* NeighborsReg
* xgboostReg
* RandomForestReg

We get the above output for 10,000 scrapped and analysed data of immoweb.
This helps to predict 'price' for new data
